# 9-Survive


## Background and Overview
9-Survive is an interactive game inspired by a [Google Doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/halloween-2016) but instead of fighting off ghosts, you will be warding off workplace hazards like incoming emails, chatty co-workers, micro-managers, and the big boss, the CEO. The user will be typing a series of commands to fight off their attacker before they get to close. If the attacker gets too close, you lose a life. 
***
## Functionality & MVPs

In 9-Survive, users will be able to:
* Fight off workplace hazards with a series of keyboard strokes.
* The user can get coffee cup boosts to power up against their attackers or regain a lost life.  
* The game continues unless the attackers close in on the user and the user loses 3 lives.
* The speed of the attackers and difficulty in defeating them increases each level.
