# 9-Survive

[9 - Survive](https://sabrinawdesmond.github.io/9-Survive/)

## Instructions
Try to survive the work day by attacking all your distractions!

1. Use the keyboard arrow keys to aim and fire at the incoming distractions.
2. Try to survive for as long as you can!


## Background and Overview
9-Survive is an interactive game inspired by a [Google Doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/halloween-2016) but instead of fighting off ghosts, you will be warding off workplace hazards like incoming emails, chatty co-workers, micro-managers, and the big boss, the CEO. The user will use the keyboard arrows to fight off their attacker before they get to close. If the attacker gets too close, you lose a life. 
***
## Functionality & MVPs

In 9-Survive:
* There will be a series of randomized attacks from workplace distractions.
